# To start using:

Currently, if you want to use the server on you machine, you will need to first add the mock data using POST /api/items and fill the data manually.
Mock JSON data can be found here: BACK-END\mock_data.
I recommend using 'Postman' to simulate HTTP requests.
For easy visualization of the DB, use a MongoDB client ('Compass' for example).

# To run:

1. yarn
2. yarn start (Server running on 9000)

# Tested APIs:

1. localhost:9000/api/items -> Get all items
